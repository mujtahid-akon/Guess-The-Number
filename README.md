# Guess-The-Number: A Game based on Binary Search

It is a **Console-based Game** written in Java for the students of CSE220: Data Structures Course taken by me at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/mujtahid-al-islam-akon). It uses the concept of Binary Search & also shows how this concept can be used to crack this awesome(!) game smartly. 

Happy Guessing!
